We are building a project where we take a website URL as an input from the user and perform active scan on the website using owasp zap opensource software. 
The results generated will be store in the database and also it will be provided to the end user in the form of a text file.
The end result consists of list of vulnerabilities detected, their cweids, alerts, solution etc.
We have written the program in the python script.
We have used mysql database and also react to create the frontend.
We have used flask framework to create the application.
